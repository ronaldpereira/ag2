title: MCP Clients
---

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that defines a standardized way to provide context to large language models (LLMs). By using MCP, applications can seamlessly interact with LLMs in a structured and efficient manner, making it easier to exchange information, use external tools, and enhance the capabilities of language models in a consistent and reusable way.

This guide will walk you through how to create **MCP clients** that connect to MCP servers, enabling you to utilize external tools and processes efficiently.
