title: Google Search Tool
---

The Google Search integration in AG2 allows users to perform real-time web searches within the AG2 framework. This is especially useful for retrieving up-to-date information that may not be available in static datasets.

## Installation

To get started with the `Google Search` integration in AG2, follow these steps:

Install AG2 with the `google-search` extra.
Since our examples also use `openai` and `gemini`, install them as well:

```bash
pip install -U ag2[openai,gemini,google-search]
```
> **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
> ```bash
> pip install -U autogen[openai,gemini,google-search]
> ```
> or
> ```bash
> pip install -U pyautogen[openai,gemini,google-search]
> ```
> as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.

You're all set! Now you can start using Google Search with AG2.

## Imports

```python
import os

import autogen
from autogen import AssistantAgent, LLMConfig
from autogen.tools.experimental import GoogleSearchTool
```

## Using GoogleSearchTool with Gemini GenAI

The [`GoogleSearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/GoogleSearchTool) enables search functionalities in AG2 and can be configured to use Gemini GenAI for an enhanced search experience. This section covers agent configuration and tool initialization.

### Agent Configuration

```python
llm_config = LLMConfig(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST").where(model="gemini-2.0-flash")

with llm_config:
    assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant")
```

### GoogleSearchTool Initialization

For Gemini GenAI, you can use the GenAI prebuilt Google Search tool by setting `use_internal_llm_tool_if_available` to `True`.

> **Note:** You cannot combine other tools with the prebuilt Google Search tool. If you need multiple tools, refer to the AG2 implementation section.

```python
gs_tool = GoogleSearchTool(
    use_internal_llm_tool_if_available=True,
)
# Once initialized, register the tool with the assistant
gs_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

### Start the Conversation

With the setup complete, you can now use the assistant to fetch live web search results.

```python
response = assistant.run(
    message="What happened with stock prices after deepseek was launched, please search the web.",
    tools=assistant.tools,
    max_turns=2,
    user_input=False,
)

# Iterate through the chat automatically with console output
response.process()
````

### Output
```console
user (to assistant):

What happened with stock prices after deepseek was launched, please search the web.

The launch of DeepSeek R1 in late January 2025 had a significant, albeit temporary, impact on the stock market, particularly affecting technology companies with large AI footprints. Here's a breakdown of what happened:

**Initial Market Reaction (Late January 2025):**

*   **Stock Market Sell-off:** The release of DeepSeek's R1 model triggered a stock market sell-off, with the Nasdaq dropping 3.1% on January 28, 2025.
*   **Nvidia's Losses:** Nvidia experienced a significant plunge, with shares dropping nearly 17% and losing approximately $600 billion in market capitalization. This was reported as the largest single-day loss in US history for a company. Some sources say the market cap loss was $593 billion.
*   **Other Tech Companies Affected:** Other major tech companies, including Microsoft, Broadcom, and Alphabet, also saw their stock prices decline. Siemens Energy in Europe also dropped.
*   **Overall Market Impact:** It's estimated that the DeepSeek announcement wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market value across US exchanges.

**Reasons for the Impact:**

*   **Cost Efficiency:** DeepSeek's R1 model was reported to be on par with leading proprietary models like GPT-4 but was trained at a significantly lower cost (around $6 million).
*   **Open-Source Nature:** The open-source nature of DeepSeek R1 challenged the assumption that AI development requires massive capital investment and expensive hardware.
*   **Competition:** DeepSeek's emergence as a strong competitor to companies like OpenAI raised concerns about market dominance and the future of AI development.

**Subsequent Recovery and Shifts:**

*   **Stock Recovery:** The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded shortly after the initial sell-off, with Nvidia's stock surging nearly 9% the next day.

## GoogleSearchTool with AG2 Google Search implementation

For all other LLM providers or if you need to combine Google Search with other tools, follow this section to configure AG2’s implementation.

### Setup Google Search Engine and API Key
1. Create a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE):
   - [Go to Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/)
   - Click `Get Started` and create a search engine.
   - Under `Sites to Search`, select `Search the entire web` if you want global search.
   - Copy the **Search Engine ID** from the CSE dashboard  (`cx` parameter from the url)
2. Get a Google API Key:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**, search for **Custom Search API** and enable it.
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**, click on **Create Credentials > API key** and copy it.
3. Export engine ID and api key
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_engine_id"
    export GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    ```

### Agent Configuration

```python
llm_config = LLMConfig(path="OAI_CONFIG_LIST").where(model="gpt-4o-mini")

with llm_config:
    assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant")
```

### GoogleSearchTool Initialization

Create [`GoogleSearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/GoogleSearchTool) with your `search_api_key` and `search_engine_id`.

```python
search_api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY")
search_engine_id = os.getenv("GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID")

assert search_api_key is not None, "Please set GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY environment variable"
assert search_engine_id is not None, "Please set GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID environment variable"

gs_tool = GoogleSearchTool(
    search_api_key=search_api_key,
    search_engine_id=search_engine_id,
)
# Once initialized, register the tool with the assistant:
gs_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

### Start the Conversation

With the setup complete, you can now use the assistant to fetch live web search results.

```python
response = assistant.run(
    message="What happened with stock prices after deepseek was launched, please search the web.",
    tools=assistant.tools,
    max_turns=2,
    user_input=False,
)

# Iterate through the chat automatically with console output
response.process()
```

### Output
```console
user (to assistant):

What happened with stock prices after deepseek was launched, please search the web.
