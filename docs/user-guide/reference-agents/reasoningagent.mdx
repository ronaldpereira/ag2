[`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent) is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.

Here, we demonstrate the key features and capabilities of the [`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent), showing how it can effectively reason about problems.

## Search Strategies

The [`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent) supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:

### 1. Beam Search (Default)
- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step
- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria
- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation
- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought

### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula
- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards
- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima
- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant

### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)
- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation
- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement
- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning

## Core Components

1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process
2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step
3. **Interim Execution**: Option to execute the selected steps, enabling stepwise reasoning.
4. **Code Execution**: a child user agent will execute code automatically during reasoning
5. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration
6. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths
7. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model
8. **Configuration Options**: The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary
9. **Customizabilty with scope**: Define task-specific context to guide the agentâ€™s reasoning.

## Configuration Options

The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary:

```python
import random

from autogen.agents.experimental import ReasoningAgent, ThinkNode
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, LLMConfig

# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

verbose = True

question = "What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?"
random.seed(1)  # setup seed for reproducibility

def last_meaningful_msg(sender, recipient, summary_args):
    import warnings

    if sender == recipient:
        return "TERMINATE"

    summary = ""
    chat_messages = recipient.chat_messages[sender]

    for msg in reversed(chat_messages):
        try:
            content = msg["content"]
            if isinstance(content, str):
                summary = content.replace("TERMINATE", "")
            elif isinstance(content, list):
                # Remove the `TERMINATE` word in the content list.
                summary = "\n".join(
                    x["text"].replace("TERMINATE", "") for x in content if isinstance(x, dict) and "text" in x
                )
            if summary.strip().rstrip():
                return summary
        except (IndexError, AttributeError) as e:
            warnings.warn(f"Cannot extract summary using last_msg: {e}. Using an empty str as summary.", UserWarning)
    return summary

    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
      name="user_proxy",
      human_input_mode="NEVER",
      code_execution_config=False,
      is_termination_msg=lambda x: True, # terminate when reasoning agent responds
   )
```

## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with DFS

The simplest form of tree-based reasoning uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore a single path, similar to OpenAI's O1 feature.
By setting `method="dfs"` in the reason_config, the agent will:
1. Generate one reasoning step at a time
2. Follow that single path until reaching a conclusion
3. Never explore alternative branches

Note: The effectiveness depends on the underlying model's training. Models not specifically trained for step-by-step reasoning
may show limited improvement with this approach.

Note 2: To enable the execution of each selected step before generating the next step suggestions, pass
`"interim_execution": True` in reason_config.

```python
with llm_config:
    reason_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="reason_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        reason_config={"method": "dfs", "max_depth": 3},  # Using DFS
        silent=False,
        # NOTE: it is equivalent to use beam size 1 for O1-style reasoning
        # reason_config={"method": "beam_search", "beam_size": 1, "max_depth": 3},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(reason_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

To predict the expected maximum value of rolling a 6-sided dice three times, we can utilize statistical techniques and concepts from probability theory, specifically order statistics. Here is the detailed solution:

### Probabilistic Approach Using Order Statistics

1. **Probability Distribution**: The value from a single roll of a fair 6-sided dice ranges uniformly from 1 to 6, each with probability \( \frac{1}{6} \).

2. **Order Statistics**:
   - When rolling the dice three times, we are interested in the distribution of the maximum value.
   - For a 6-sided dice, given \( n \) rolls, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) represents the probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \( k \).

3. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   - Let \( X_{max} \) be the maximum value from the three rolls.
   - The probability that \( X_{max} \leq k \):
     \[
     P(X_{max} \leq k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3
     \]
   - This represents that all three dice rolls result in values less than or equal to \( k \).

4. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:
   - The probability that \( X_{max} = k \) can be found by considering the probabilities that the maximum value is less than or equal to \( k \) but greater than \( k-1 \):
     \[
     P(X_{max} = k) = P(X_{max} \leq k) - P(X_{max} \leq k-1) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3
     \]

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected maximum value can be calculated using:
     \[
     E[X_{max}] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(X_{max} = k)
     \]
   - Plugging in the PMF:
     \[
     E[X_{max}] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \left[\left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3 \right]
     \]

6. **Computational Evaluation**:
   - Perform the summation:
     \[
     E[X_{max}] = 1 \left[\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 - \left(0\right)^3 \right] + 2 \left[\left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \right] + \ldots + 6 \left[\left(\frac{6}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 \right]
     \]

By evaluating this sum numerically, you get:

\[
E[X_{max}] \approx 4.47
\]

Thus, the expected maximum value if you roll a 6-sided dice three times is approximately \( \mathbf{4.47} \).
```

## Beam Search in Tree of Thought

Beam Search is a powerful technique used in tree-based reasoning that allows the agent to explore multiple paths simultaneously. By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.

In this approach, the agent generates multiple reasoning steps in parallel, allowing it to compare different trajectories and select the most promising ones for further exploration. This can lead to more robust and accurate conclusions, especially in scenarios where intermediate evaluations are critical to the final outcome.

```python
with llm_config:
    reason_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="reason_agent",
        reason_config={"method": "beam_search", "beam_size": 3}
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(reason_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

To find the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times, we can approach this problem using probability theory and the concept of order statistics.

### Plan
1. **Derive Probability Distribution**: Determine the probability distribution of the maximum value when rolling three 6-sided dice.
2. **Calculate Expected Value**: Use the probability distribution to calculate the expected value of the maximum roll.

### Derivation
1. A 6-sided die has outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
2. For each possible maximum value \( x \), we need to find the probability \( P(\text{max} = x) \).

Let \( X_i \) be the result of roll i.

The probability that the maximum value is \( x \), \( P(\text{max} = x) \) is:
\[ P(\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) = x) = P(\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \leq x) - P(\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \leq x-1) \]

Using the complement rule and the fact that the rolls are independent:
\[ P(\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \leq x) = (P(X_1 \leq x) \cdot P(X_2 \leq x) \cdot P(X_3 \leq x)) = (x/6)^3 \]
\[ P(\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \leq x-1) = ((x-1)/6)^3 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(\text{max} = x) = (x/6)^3 - ((x-1)/6)^3 \]

3. **Calculate Expected Value**:
\[ E[\text{max}] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} x \cdot P(\text{max} = x) \]

### Python Code
We can implement the above calculations in Python to find the expected value.

```python
# filename: expected_max_dice_value.py
import numpy as np

# Calculate the probabilities
prob_max = [(i / 6) ** 3 - ((i - 1) / 6) ** 3 for i in range(1, 7)]

# Expected value computation
expected_max = sum(i * prob for i, prob in enumerate(prob_max, start=1))

print(f'The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided dice three times is: {expected_max}')
```

Execute this script to compute the expected value using the derived probabilities. This will provide the precise expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided dice three times.
````

We can see that in this case the agent suggests to execute a script. Later, we will see how it can do this internally.

### Beam Search with Batch Grading
By default, node grading is performed one at a time. While this approach is often sufficient, certain applications benefit from a batched grading approach on each beam expansion. In other words, instead of grading all nodes across the entire search in a single pass, we group each beam's newly expanded nodes into a single batch for grading. This yields:

1. **Context-aware evaluation**: Within a single beam iteration, the grader can compare and contrast multiple node expansions at once.
2. **Improved efficiency**: Combining multiple evaluations into one request per beam iteration can reduce the total number of LLM calls.

To enable batch grading, set `"batch_grading": True` in the `reason_config`. By default, `batch_grading` is set to `False`, meaning individual node grading is performed without batching.

```python
with llm_config:
    reason_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="reason_agent", reason_config={"method": "beam_search", "beam_size": 3, "batch_grading": True}
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(reason_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

To determine the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided dice three times, we need to follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Determine cumulative distribution function (CDF)
First, identify the probability that the maximum roll is less than or equal to each possible value (from 1 to 6).

### Step 2: Derive probabilities for each possible maximum in three rolls
Next, use the cumulative distribution function to calculate the probabilities of obtaining a specific maximum outcome.

### Step 3: Compute the expectation
Calculate the expected maximum value by taking the weighted sum of possible maximum values and their corresponding probabilities.

### Step 4: Detailed Expected Value Calculation
Calculate the expected maximum dice value with detailed intermediate steps.

Here's the Python code to accomplish the task:

```python
import numpy as np

# Number of sides on the dice
n_sides = 6
# Number of rolls
n_rolls = 3

# Function to calculate the probability of the maximum roll being k
def prob_max_is_k(k, n_sides, n_rolls):
    return (k**n_rolls - (k-1)**n_rolls) / n_sides**n_rolls

# Calculate probabilities for each maximum value
probabilities = [prob_max_is_k(k, n_sides, n_rolls) for k in range(1, n_sides + 1)]

# Calculate expected maximum value
expected_max_value = sum(k * prob for k, prob in enumerate(probabilities, 1))

print(f"Probabilities for each maximum value: {probabilities}")
print(f"Expected maximum value: {expected_max_value}")
```

Execute the code to get the result and follow through step-by-step calculations.

## MCTS
This section demonstrates how to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with [`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent) for complex reasoning tasks. MCTS provides several advantages over beam search when:

1. Ground truth evaluation is available
2. LLM-based evaluation is expensive
3. You want to generate diverse, high-quality training data

```python
with llm_config:
    mcts_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
        reason_config={"method": "mcts", "nsim": 3, "max_depth": 4},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(mcts_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

```console
Let's break down the problem step by step, using the trajectory described:

### Step 1: Statistical Properties

Consider a 6-sided die with faces numbered from 1 to 6. We want to find the expected maximum value when rolling the die three times.

### Step 2: Probability Distribution

To calculate the expected maximum value, we need to determine the probability distribution for the maximum value when rolling three times:

- The probability that the maximum value is 1: All three rolls must be 1.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 2: At least one roll must be 2, and no roll can be greater than 2.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 3: At least one roll must be 3, and no roll can be greater than 3.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 4: At least one roll must be 4, and no roll can be greater than 4.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 5: At least one roll must be 5, and no roll can be greater than 5.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 6: At least one roll must be 6.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Maximum Value

To find the expected maximum value, we multiply each possible maximum value by its probability and sum the results:

\[
E[\text{max}] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating these products:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1}{216} + \frac{14}{216} + \frac{57}{216} + \frac{148}{216} + \frac{305}{216} + \frac{546}{216}
\]

Summing them up:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96
\]

### Final Answer

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately 4.96.
```

## LATS

It is important to note that our reasoning agent operates based on "process" and lacks direct access to the environment. In contrast, the LATS approach relies on feedback from the environment. To address this, we utilize our existing grader agent to generate pseudo-rewards and provide feedback. The major difference between our LATS implementation and our MCTS implementation is that the LATS approach incorporate the reflection into prompt context before next round of simulation. You can define the agent using the LATS approach as follows.

```python
with llm_config:
    lats_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
        reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 3, "max_depth": 4},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(lats_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

  \[
  P(\text{max}=2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 3: At least one roll must be 3, and no roll can be greater than 3.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 4: At least one roll must be 4, and no roll can be greater than 4.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 5: At least one roll must be 5, and no roll can be greater than 5.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 6: At least one roll must be 6.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Maximum Value

To find the expected maximum value, we multiply each possible maximum value by its probability and sum the results:

\[
E[\text{max}] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating these products:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1}{216} + \frac{14}{216} + \frac{57}{216} + \frac{148}{216} + \frac{305}{216} + \frac{546}{216}
\]

Summing them up:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96
\]

### Final Answer

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately 4.96.

## Interim Execution During Reasoning

You can enable `interim_execution` by setting it to `True` in `reason_config`. This allows intermediate steps to be executed during the reasoning process, promoting more effective step-by-step thinking and enabling future steps to be informed by the outputs of earlier ones.
By default `interim_execution` is `False` which means that the selected steps won't be executed during reasoning.

```python
with llm_config:
    lats_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 3, "max_depth": 4, "interim_execution": True},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(lats_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)

Given a thinking process, you have to provide a complete response to a user's question.
Question:
What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?

Thinking process:
# Question:
Content: What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?
---
# Trajectory:

Step 1:
Content: Identify the process
To determine the expected maximum dice value, we need to calculate the probability for each possible maximum value (1 through 6) across three rolls and compute the expected value using these probabilities.

Step 2:
Content: Probability calculation
Calculate the probability of each possible maximum value (1 through 6) for three rolls. The probability that the maximum value is exactly \( k \) can be computed using the formula:
\[ P(\text{max} = k) = \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{k-1}{6} \right)^3 \]

Step 3:
Content: Expected value calculation
Combine probabilities calculated for individual maximum values to determine the expected maximum value:
\[ E(\text{max}) = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(\text{max} = k) \]

Step 4:
Content: Compute individual probabilities and sum the results
Calculate each probability \( P(\text{max} = k) \) for \( k \) from 1 to 6. Use these probabilities to sum up the expected value:
\[ E(\text{max}) = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \left( \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{k-1}{6} \right)^3 \right) \]

Step 5:
Content: Final result
Compute the numerical value of the expected maximum.

Final Answer:
Let's perform the calculations step-by-step.

The probability that the maximum value after rolling three times is less than or equal to \( k \) is:
\[ P(\text{max} \le k) = \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 \]

Therefore, the probability that the maximum value is exactly \( k \) is:
\[ P(\text{max} = k) = P(\text{max} \le k) - P(\text{max} \le k-1) = \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{k-1}{6} \right)^3 \]

We can calculate the expected value using these probabilities:
\[
E(\text{max}) = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(\text{max} = k)
\]
Substituting the probabilities, we get:
\[
E(\text{max}) = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \left( \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{k-1}{6} \right)^3 \right)
\]

Let's calculate each term:
\[
P(\text{max}=1) = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{0}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
\]
\[
P(\text{max}=2) = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
\]
\[
P(\text{max}=3) = \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
\]
\[
P(\text{max}=4) = \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
\]
\[
P(\text{max}=5) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
\]
\[
P(\text{max}=6) = \left( \frac{6}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
\]

Now, calculate the expected maximum:
\[
E(\text{max}) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

\[
E(\text{max}) = \frac{1}{216} + \frac{14}{216} + \frac{57}{216} + \frac{148}{216} + \frac{305}{216} + \frac{546}{216}
\]

\[
E(\text{max}) = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.958
\]

Thus, if you roll a 6-sided die three times, the expected maximum value is approximately 4.958.
```

## Code Execution During Reasoning

You can setup the parameter `code_execution_config` in reasoning agent to enable code execution during reasoning.
By default, `code_execution_config=False`, which means it will not execute code for reasoning. Note that to allow for code execution, `interim_execution` must be set to `True` at `reason_config`.

```python
with llm_config:
    lats_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 3, "max_depth": 4, 'interim_execution': True},
        code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "mypy_cache"},
        # Enable Code execution. We skip docker here for simplicity
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    lats_agent,
    message=question + " Run a python simulation to get the result",
    summary_method=last_meaningful_msg
    )

print(ans.summary)
```

````console
Sure, I can run a Python simulation to estimate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided dice three times. Here is the Python script:

```python
import random
import collections

def roll_and_max():
    rolls = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(3)]
    return max(rolls)

def simulate_max_dice_value(num_trials):
    results = [roll_and_max() for _ in range(num_trials)]
    expected_max_value = sum(results) / num_trials
    return expected_max_value

def analyze_distribution(num_trials):
    results = [roll_and_max() for _ in range(num_trials)]
    counter = collections.Counter(results)
    for value in sorted(counter):
        print(f"Maximum Value: {value}, Frequency: {counter[value]}")

num_trials = 10000  # Running with 10,000 trials for better estimation
print(f"Expected maximum dice value: {simulate_max_dice_value(num_trials)}")
analyze_distribution(num_trials)
```

Copy and run this code snippet. It will print the expected maximum dice value and the distribution of maximum values over 10,000 trials.

Here's what the output might look like:

```python
Expected maximum dice value: 4.6083
Maximum Value: 2, Frequency: 48
Maximum Value: 3, Frequency: 166
Maximum Value: 4, Frequency: 599
Maximum Value: 5, Frequency: 2237
Maximum Value: 6, Frequency: 6950
```

From the simulation, the expected maximum dice value when rolling a 6-sided dice three times seems to be around 4.6083. The distribution shows that a maximum value of 6 is the most frequent outcome, which makes sense given the nature of the dice rolls.

To visualize the reasoning tree, you need to install Graphviz. Please note that using `pip install` may not be sufficient for all operating systems. In some cases, you might need to manually download and install Graphviz.

`pip install graphviz`

### To save the visualization as "tree_of_thoughts.png", run the following command:
```python
mcts_agent.visualize_tree()
```

## Utilizing ReasoningAgent for Nested Chat Interactions

In this example, we will explore how the [`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent) can be employed to facilitate nested chat interactions, specifically for writing a blog post about NVIDIA. The agent will engage in a structured dialogue to enhance the quality of the content through iterative feedback and reasoning.

### Task: Writing a Blog Post on NVIDIA

The goal is to generate a concise yet engaging blog post about NVIDIA. The process involves one turn (for simplicity) of conversation where the agent reflects on the content, reasons about improvements, and incorporates user feedback. You can update the `max_turns` parameter to execute multiple times.

```python
with llm_config:
    writer = AssistantAgent(
        name="Writer",
        system_message="""You are a professional writer, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.
You should improve the quality of the content based on the feedback from the user.
    """,
    )
    reason_agent_for_writer = ReasoningAgent(
        name="reason_agent",
        reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 2, "max_depth": 3},
    )

def reflection_message(recipient, messages, sender, config):
    print("Reflecting...", "yellow")
    return f"Reflect, Reason and provide critique on the following writing. \n\n {recipient.chat_messages_for_summary(sender)[-1]['content']}"

user_proxy.register_nested_chats(
    [
        {
            "recipient": reason_agent_for_writer,
            "message": reflection_message,
            "summary_method": "last_msg",
            "max_turns": 1,
        }
    ],
    trigger=writer,
)

task = """Write a concise but engaging blogpost about Nvidia."""
res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(recipient=writer, message=task, max_turns=2, summary_method="last_msg")

print(res.summary)
```
```console

## Use a different Model for Grading

To use a different model for grading instead of gpt-4o, pass the `grader_llm_config` argument when initializing the [`ReasoningAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/ReasoningAgent). This ensures that the grading of trajectories is performed using the specified configuration from the `config_list`, separate from the main `llm_config`.

```python
# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
grader_llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

with llm_config:
    writer = AssistantAgent(
        name="Writer",
        system_message="""You are a professional writer, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.
You should improve the quality of the content based on the feedback from the user.
        """,
    )
    reason_agent_for_writer = ReasoningAgent(
        name="reason_agent",
        grader_llm_config=grader_llm_config,
        reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 2, "max_depth": 3},
    )
```

## Save data to future training
In this section, we will focus on saving the reasoning agent's decision-making data to help future training.

By capturing the structure and content of the reasoning tree, we can create a valuable dataset that can be used to enhance the agent's learning process. This data will allow us to analyze the agent's reasoning patterns, improve its performance, and refine its ability to generate high-quality responses.

The saved data can be utilized for various training methodologies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ultimately contributing to the development of a more robust and effective reasoning agent.

```python
import json

data = reason_agent._root.to_dict()
with open("reasoning_tree.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# recover the node
new_node = ThinkNode.from_dict(json.load(open("reasoning_tree.json")))  # noqa: SIM115

sft_data = reason_agent.extract_sft_dataset()
rlhf_data = reason_agent.extract_rlhf_preference_dataset()

print(rlhf_data)
```

## Utilizing Ground Truth to Enhance Training Data Generation

Access to ground truth answers allows us to improve the evaluation of reasoning paths. In this section, we will explore:
- The process of incorporating ground truth into prompts
- The methods by which the agent leverages ground truth for evaluation

```python
prompt = """What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?

GROUND_TRUTH:
We define X as the highest outcome among the three rolls.
The probability that X is at least m is 1 - \\left(\frac{m-1}{6}\right)^3 for each m from 1 to 6.
Summing these probabilities gives the expectation E(X) = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} [1 - (\frac{m-1}{6})^3].
Calculating this sum results in E(X) = 6 - \frac{225}{216} = \frac{119}{24}, which approximates to 4.9583.
Therefore, the expected maximum value when rolling a six-sided die three times is \frac{119}{24} or approximately 4.9583.
"""
random.seed(1)  # setup seed for reproducibility

with llm_config:
    mcts_agent2 = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
        reason_config={"method": "mcts", "nsim": 3, "max_depth": 4},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(mcts_agent2, message=prompt, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

```console
Let's break down the problem step by step, using the trajectory described:

### Step 1: Statistical Properties

Consider a 6-sided die with faces numbered from 1 to 6. We want to find the expected maximum value when rolling the die three times.

### Step 2: Probability Distribution

To calculate the expected maximum value, we need to determine the probability distribution for the maximum value when rolling three times:

- The probability that the maximum value is 1: All three rolls must be 1.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 2: At least one roll must be 2, and no roll can be greater than 2.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 3: At least one roll must be 3, and no roll can be greater than 3.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 4: At least one roll must be 4, and no roll can be greater than 4.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 5: At least one roll must be 5, and no roll can be greater than 5.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- The probability that the maximum value is 6: At least one roll must be 6.
  \[
  P(\text{max}=6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Maximum Value

To find the expected maximum value, we multiply each possible maximum value by its probability and sum the results:

\[
E[\text{max}] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating these products:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1}{216} + \frac{14}{216} + \frac{57}{216} + \frac{148}{216} + \frac{305}{216} + \frac{546}{216}
\]

Summing them up:

\[
E[\text{max}] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96
\]

### Final Answer

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately 4.96.
```

## Forest of Thoughts

The concept of a "Forest of Thoughts" allows us to leverage bootstrapping techniques to execute the tree of thoughts multiple times, creating a diverse set of answers. After running these independent reasoning processes, we can aggregate them to form our final answer.

```python
with llm_config:
    forest_agent = ReasoningAgent(
        name="mcts_agent",
        system_message="answer math questions",
        # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
        reason_config={"method": "dfs", "max_depth": 4, "forest_size": 3},
    )

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(forest_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```
```console
To find the expected maximum dice value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Use statistical properties and formulas to determine the expected maximum value of rolling a 6-sided die three times.

Step 2: Calculate the probability distribution of the maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times. Consider each possible outcome (1 through 6). The probability that \(k\) will be the maximum value can be calculated by considering the likelihood that all three rolls are less than or equal to \(k\) and at least one roll equals \(k\).

Probability \(P(X = k)\):
1. For \(k = 1\):
\[ P(X = 1) = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{216} \]
2. For \(k = 2\):
\[ P(X = 2) = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216} \]
3. For \(k = 3\):
\[ P(X = 3) = \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216} \]
4. For \(k = 4\):
\[ P(X = 4) = \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216} \]
5. For \(k = 5\):
\[ P(X = 5) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216} \]
6. For \(k = 6\):
\[ P(X = 6) = 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216} \]

Step 3: Sum the weighted probabilities to find the expected maximum value

The expected maximum value \(E[X]\) is calculated by summing the products of each maximum value by its probability:

\[ E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(X = k) \]
\[ E[X] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216} \]
\[ E[X] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} \]
\[ E[X] = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96 \]

Final Answer: The expected maximum dice value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \(4.96\).
```

## Scope
The effectiveness of a LLM agent on a given task can be significantly enhanced through prompt optimization. To support this for the `ReasoningAgent`, a `scope` parameter can be specified during initialization. This parameter will provide valuable context about the agentâ€™s intended use, the reasoning process it should follow, and any constraints or pitfalls to avoid. This information is incorporated into the agentâ€™s thought process to guide its behavior more effectively.

Note: The `scope` differs from the `system_message` in that it informs the agentâ€™s reasoning throughout the entire thinking process, whereas the `system_message` is used solely when generating the final response.

```python
scope = """You assess ethical risks of AI systems used in services.
