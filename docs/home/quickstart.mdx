## Getting Started with AG2

This guide will help you set up AG2 and implement your first multi-agent workflow.

### Setting Up Your Environment

<Tip>
We recommended using a virtual environment for your project to keep your packages contained. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank">venv</a>.
</Tip>

**Installation**

AG2 requires **Python version >= 3.9, < 3.14**. Install AG2 with OpenAI integration using pip:

```bash
pip install ag2[openai]
```

The package is available under `ag2`, `pyautogen`, or `autogen` names. The default installation includes minimal dependencies, you can add extra options based on your specific requirements.

<Warning>
**From version 0.8**: The OpenAI package, `openai`, is not installed by default.

Install AG2 with your preferred model provider(s), for example:

- `pip install ag2[openai]`
- `pip install ag2[gemini]`
- `pip install ag2[anthropic,cohere,mistral]`

On Mac OS, if you get "no matches found:", add a quote to the package name, for example:
- `pip install "ag2[openai]"`
</Warning>

### Implementing Your First Agent Workflow

The following example demonstrates a fundamental use case of the AG2 framework - creating a Conversable agent that responds to a prompt.

Create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook with the following code:

```python
# 1. Import our agent class
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig

# 2. Define our LLM configuration for OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
#    uses the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

# 3. Create our LLM agent
with llm_config:
    my_agent = ConversableAgent(
        name="helpful_agent",
        system_message="You are a poetic AI assistant, respond in rhyme.",
    )

# 4. Run the agent with a prompt
response = my_agent.run(
    message="In one sentence, what's the big deal about AI?",
    max_turns=3,
)

# 5. Iterate through the chat automatically with console output
response.process()

# 6. Print the chat
print(response.messages)
```

<Note>

Before running this code, make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable. This example uses `gpt-4o-mini`, but you can replace it with any other [model](../user-guide/models/amazon-bedrock) supported by AG2.

=== "macOS / Linux"

    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

</Note>


### Running the Example

To run the example, execute the script or notebook. The agents will communicate and work together to complete the task.

Python Script:

```shell
# 1. Save the code to a file (e.g., first_agent.py)
# 2. Run the script
python first_agent.py
```

Jupyter Notebook:

- Create a new notebook cell and paste the code
- Execute the cell

When executed, this code creates a poetic agent that responds to your query about AI with a rhyming answer.

## Core Agent Concepts

AG2 provides several foundational agent types and interaction patterns to build sophisticated AI systems. Here are the key concepts:

- **Conversable Agent:** The fundamental building block that can send messages, receive messages, and generate responses using GenAI models, external tools, or human input.
- **Human in the Loop:** Seamlessly integrate human judgment and expertise into agent workflows, allowing for oversight, guidance, and collaboration at critical decision points.
- **Orchestrating Multiple Agents:** Coordinate complex agent interactions through built-in patterns like swarms, group chats, nested conversations, and sequential workflows—or create custom orchestration by registering specialized reply methods.
- **Tools:** Extend agent capabilities by registering external programs and APIs that agents can invoke and execute to access specialized functionality or data.

### Conversable agent

The [ConversableAgent](../api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent) is the fundamental building block of AG2, designed to enable seamless communication between AI entities. This core agent type handles message exchange and response generation, serving as the base class for all agents in the framework.

In the example below, we'll create a simple information validation workflow with two specialized agents that communicate with each other:

```python
# 1. Import ConversableAgent class
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig

# 2. Define our LLM configuration for OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
#    uses the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")


# 3. Create our LLM agent
with llm_config:
  # Create an AI agent
  assistant = ConversableAgent(
      name="assistant",
      system_message="You are an assistant that responds concisely.",
  )

  # Create another AI agent
  fact_checker = ConversableAgent(
      name="fact_checker",
      system_message="You are a fact-checking assistant.",
  )

# 4. Start the conversation
assistant.initiate_chat(
    recipient=fact_checker,
    message="What is AG2?",
    max_turns=2
)
```

When you run this code, you'll see a simple fact-checking interaction in action. The assistant agent initiates the conversation by asking "What is AG2?", and the fact-checker agent responds with information about the AG2 framework.

### Human in the loop

Human oversight is crucial for many AI workflows, especially when dealing with critical decisions, creative tasks, or situations requiring expert judgment. AG2 makes integrating human feedback seamless through its human-in-the-loop functionality.
You can configure how and when human input is solicited using the `human_input_mode` parameter:

- `ALWAYS`: Requires human input for every response
- `NEVER`: Operates autonomously without human involvement
- `TERMINATE`: Only requests human input to end conversations

For convenience, AG2 provides the specialized `UserProxyAgent` class that automatically sets `human_input_mode` to `ALWAYS` and supports code execution:

```python
# 1. Import ConversableAgent and UserProxyAgent classes
from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent, LLMConfig

# 2. Define our LLM configuration for OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
#    uses the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")


# 3. Create our LLM agent
with llm_config:
  assistant = ConversableAgent(
      name="assistant",
      system_message="You are a helpful assistant.",
  )

# 4. Create a human agent with manual input mode
human = ConversableAgent(
    name="human",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS"
)
# or
human = UserProxyAgent(name="human", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding", "use_docker": False})

# 5. Start the chat
human.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message="Hello! What's 2 + 2?"
)

```

In this example, the human serves as both the conversation initiator and an active participant. You'll be prompted for input at each step, allowing you to guide the assistant, validate its responses, and provide additional context as needed—essential for workflows where human judgment and domain expertise are required.

### Orchestrating multiple agents

AG2 enables sophisticated multi-agent collaboration through flexible orchestration patterns, allowing you to create dynamic systems where specialized agents work together to solve complex problems.

The framework offers both custom orchestration and several built-in collaboration patterns including `GroupChat` and `Swarm`.

Here's how to implement a collaborative team for curriculum development using GroupChat:

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager, LLMConfig

# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

planner_message = """You are a classroom lesson agent.
Given a topic, write a lesson plan for a fourth grade class.
Use the following format:
<title>Lesson plan title</title>
<learning_objectives>Key learning objectives</learning_objectives>
<script>How to introduce the topic to the kids</script>
"""

reviewer_message = """You are a classroom lesson reviewer.
You compare the lesson plan to the fourth grade curriculum and provide a maximum of 3 recommended changes.
Provide only one round of reviews to a lesson plan.
"""

# 1. Add a separate 'description' for our planner and reviewer agents
planner_description = "Creates or revises lesson plans."

reviewer_description = """Provides one round of reviews to a lesson plan
for the lesson_planner to revise."""

with llm_config:
    lesson_planner = ConversableAgent(
        name="planner_agent",
        system_message=planner_message,
        description=planner_description,
    )

    lesson_reviewer = ConversableAgent(
        name="reviewer_agent",
        system_message=reviewer_message,
        description=reviewer_description,
    )

# 2. The teacher's system message can also be used as a description, so we don't define it
teacher_message = """You are a classroom teacher.
You decide topics for lessons and work with a lesson planner.
and reviewer to create and finalise lesson plans.
When you are happy with a lesson plan, output "DONE!".
"""

with llm_config:
    teacher = ConversableAgent(
        name="teacher_agent",
        system_message=teacher_message,
        # 3. Our teacher can end the conversation by saying DONE!
        is_termination_msg=lambda x: "DONE!" in (x.get("content", "") or "").upper(),
    )

# 4. Create the GroupChat with agents and selection method
groupchat = GroupChat(
    agents=[teacher, lesson_planner, lesson_reviewer],
    speaker_selection_method="auto",
    messages=[],
)

# 5. Our GroupChatManager will manage the conversation and uses an LLM to select the next agent
manager = GroupChatManager(
    name="group_manager",
    groupchat=groupchat,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

# 6. Initiate the chat with the GroupChatManager as the recipient
teacher.initiate_chat(
    recipient=manager,
    message="Today, let's introduce our kids to the solar system."
)
```

When executed, this code creates a collaborative system where the teacher initiates the conversation, and the lesson planner and reviewer agents work together to create and refine a lesson plan. The GroupChatManager orchestrates the conversation, selecting the next agent to respond based on the context of the discussion.

For workflows requiring more structured processes, explore the Swarm pattern in the detailed [documentation](../user-guide/advanced-concepts/conversation-patterns-deep-dive).

### Tools

While large language models excel at generating content and reasoning, they have inherent limitations: they lack real-time data access, can't perform precise calculations reliably, and cannot interact with external systems. Tools overcome these limitations by connecting agents to specialized functions, APIs, and data sources.

With AG2's tool integration, you can:

- Access up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
- Interact with external services and databases
- Execute domain-specific operations with precision

Here's how to implement a date calculation tool:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Annotated

from autogen import ConversableAgent, register_function, LLMConfig

# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
llm_config = LLMConfig(api_type="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini")

# 1. Our tool, returns the day of the week for a given date
def get_weekday(date_string: Annotated[str, "Format: YYYY-MM-DD"]) -> str:
    date = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
    return date.strftime("%A")

# 2. Agent for determining whether to run the tool
with llm_config:
    date_agent = ConversableAgent(
        name="date_agent",
        system_message="You get the day of the week for a given date.",
    )

# 3. And an agent for executing the tool
executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="executor_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# 4. Registers the tool with the agents, the description will be used by the LLM
register_function(
    get_weekday,
    caller=date_agent,
    executor=executor_agent,
    description="Get the day of the week for a given date",
)

# 5. Two-way chat ensures the executor agent follows the suggesting agent
chat_result = executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=date_agent,
    message="I was born on the 25th of March 1995, what day was it?",
    max_turns=2,
)

print(chat_result.chat_history[-1]["content"])
```

When executed, this code determines that March 25, 1995, was a Saturday—delivering an accurate response through tool execution rather than relying on the model's potentially outdated or imprecise knowledge. This pattern can be extended to integrate any Python function, API, or external system into your agent workflows.
